It is today now.

Been playing on the minilogue, experimenting with synced and unsynced dual oscillators

I think I'll try sndfile-convert to make akai friendly files. you have to convert to .mpc files and then just rename to .snd, lol. but then use the weird floppy emulator software to create a virtual floppy. UPDATE: this worked.
